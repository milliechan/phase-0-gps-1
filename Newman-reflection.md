# Ben's GPS 1.1 Reflection

*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to this GPS session?*

I think that just putting the GitHub workflow into practice, remembering the proper sequence of commands, etc.

*What Git concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
Seeing someone else work through a full adding, staging, and committing process helped me see the big picture better which helps me focus on the details during each phase, since I have a better sense of what is needed up ahead.

*What questions did you ask your partner and the guide?*
Well during our almost two hours working together I'm sure I asked my partner, Millie, dozens of questions. But I specifically appreciated her experience in the pairing process, and she had good insights when we were brainstorming together. She was great as a navigator at researching before I even asked when she noticed I was struggling with something. Which I think also means I could get better at asking more quickly. As a driver she was also very good at thinking out loud and when I asked she also was able to clearly outline her process to me and that made my job as navigator much easier.

I also very much appreciated Katy's approach as a guide. She made it clear from the beginning that she was taking more of a hands-off approach, but she was very engaged the entire time and was able to jump in quickly a few times when we were clearly off-track or both struggling with something. I also asked about the grading process and appreciated her sharing perspective both as a DBC alum and as a guide. She also did a great job of clarifying some of the nuances of the git commands for our pair and when we asked about a couple of details that were getting us side-tracked a bit she was also good at pointing that out, as well.

*What still confuses you about Git?*
Well I would still say that I have a tremendous amount to learn, especially exploring more of the features of GitHub and the other website that integrate with Git. I also need to get more comfortable with some of the advanced terminology so that I can research more quickly on my own.

*How was our first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
Well I covered some of this in my answers in my previous feedback about my partner and our guide. But overall I found it to be an excellent experience. My partner and I worked well together and had different areas where we could contribute. I felt like she listened to me when I wanted to discuss an idea before moving forward. It was extremely useful for me to see another student work through some of the steps because I could see and hear her thought process for breaking down a problem. It was comforting when we had similar questions and I think that the experience benefited me almost as much socially, to help me feel more like part of the DBC community, and with my confidence as a student as with any particular technical question. Thanks!
