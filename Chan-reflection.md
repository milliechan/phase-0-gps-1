##GPS 1.1 Reflection##

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with Git merging and wasn't sure of the order of merging feature branches to master branches and why it mattered. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Git workflow, Git merging, and Git collaboration with my partner was clarified. Before the session, I wasn't entirely sure of the flow of sharing and working on the same repo with someone else. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? 

I asked my pair and Katy, our guide, about feature branching, when to merge changes, and Git workflow. 

* What still confuses you about Git? 

I'm a little confused about when is the best time to commit files, one by one, or all at once and at what frequency. 


* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? 

My first experience of pairing in a GPS was great and extremely helpful. After our guide left, we made a few mistakes which turned out to be extremely invaluable since we were able to enrich our learning by working together to solve the problem and learn something new. I thought the GPS was a tad long as we took almost 3 hours to finish but overall it was a good learning experience.
